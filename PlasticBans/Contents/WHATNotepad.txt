<h2>


<p><h3>Plastic bags are made from polyethylene.This begins as ethylene,then treated to become the polymer, forming long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms.</h3></p>

<h2>
<div style="background-color:royalblue;color:white;padding:0.5px;">General Plastics</h2>
<h3><ul>
<li>Plastics are created from polymers.</li>
<li>Ethylene is chemically changed into polyethylene, the building block of all plastic bags.</li>
<li>Polyethylene is made up of many winding chains of carbon atoms, interlaced with and bonded to hydrogen atoms.</li>
</ul></h3>

<div style="background-color:royalblue;color:white;padding:0.5px;">
Sources</h2>
<h3><ul>
<li>Both petroleum and natural gas are common sources and vital ingredients in almost all plastic bags available today. </li>
<li>Properly refined, they yield ethylene, which is in turn made into polyethylene.</li>
</ul></h3>

<div style="background-color:royalblue;color:white;padding:0.5px;">
HDPE Plastic</h2>
<h3><ul>
<li>HDPE stands for high density polyethylene, and is the most common type of polyethylene used to create shopping bags.</li>
<li>Our grocery bag is light yet can hold many times its own weight without tearing.</li>
</ul></h3>

<div style="background-color:royalblue;color:white;padding:0.5px;">
LDPE Plastic</h2>
<h3><ul>
<li>LDPE plastic is made from low density, branching chains of polymer materials. </li>
<li>This is used to make the tear-away bags dry cleaners use for wrapping cleaned clothes.</li>
</ul></h3>

<h2>
<div style="background-color:royalblue;color:white;padding:0.5px;">
LLDPE Plastic</h2>
<h3><ul>
<li>Known as linear low density polyethylene.</li>
<li>The shiny bags are used in clothing stores.</li>
</ul></h3>
